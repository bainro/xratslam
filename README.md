RatSlam C++ library.

The xRatSLam library implements the Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm
called RatSlam inspired by neural rodents knowing dynamics while performing self localization tasks.

Original code from MuÃ±oz et al. (2022)

## Requirements
- Unix OS
- OpenCV
- Boost

## Building and installing

> $ cd libxratslam/build  
> $ cmake .. && make install  


## How to use

The library files libxratslam.so* are installed by default at "/usr/local/lib/".
Headers are installed at "/usr/local/include/{xratslam,ratslam}".
'pkg-config' can be used to find those locations.

If you are using cmake, add to your "CMakeLists.txt":  
> find_package( PkgConfig REQUIRED )  
> pkg_check_modules( XRATSLAM REQUIRED xratslam )  

and

> target_link_libraries(  
> ...  
> ${XRATSLAM_LIBRARIES}  
> ...  
> )   

See https://github.com/mesmu/xratslam-example for a practical example.


## Insertion of a new LocalView, PoseCell or ExperienceMap implementation
  
As an example, when creating the "MyCoolLV" LocalView class, follow these steps:

1. Create MyCoolLV.{cc,hh} and other dependency files at
"libxratslam/src/xratslam/localview/" directory.

2. The "MyCoolLV" class must extend "xratslam::LocalView" class and have
a constructor accepting a "std::string" with the name of a file
containing all "MyCoolLV" settings.  
This file is supposed to formated as "<key> = <value>" elements.
The default implementations use 'boost::property_tree::ptree' to read
these settings. For an example, see: "xratslam/localview/OriginalLV.cc".
  
3. Add all "*.cc" files to the "add_library( xratslam SHARED .."
clause in the "libxratslam/CMakeList.txt" file.
Doing that those files will be compiled within the 'libxratslam' library.

4. Modify the "libxratslam/src/xratslam/Factory.cc" file to:

* Include all necessary headers to instantiate an object of "MyCoolLV" class.
Ex:  
> #include "xratslam/localview/MyCoolLV.hh"

* Let Factor knows how to instatiate objects of class "MyCoolLV":  
Add to method "Factory::createLocalView(...)"  
> if ( lvName == "MyCoolLV" )  return new xratslam::MyCoolLV( configFile );  

Note that "MyCoolLV" class is supposed to be declared within "xratslam"
namespace!

5. The same steps should be taken for "PoseCell" and "ExperienceMap"
structures, modifying all "LocalView" references, of course.


## How to customized LocalView, PoseCell or ExperienceMap implementation

In the code using libxratslam library, after instantiate a
"xratslam::RatSlam" object, you should set your customized ratslam structure.
Example:  
> RatSlam slam( configFile );  
> ...  
> slam.setLocalView( "MyCoolLV", configFile );  
 
Note that "setLocalView()" should be called before "slam.start()"!
   
If you do not do that, the original structures coded by
David Ball  (david.ball@qut.edu.au) and
Scott Heath (scott.heath@uqconnect.edu.au)
will be used.
